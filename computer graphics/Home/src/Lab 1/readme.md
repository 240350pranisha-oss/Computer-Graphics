Result:
The program ran successfully and displayed different graphical objects such as pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, and text on the screen. Various colors and positions were used, showing the correct implementation of basic drawing functions using the graphics.h library.

Conclusion:
Computer graphics helps in visually representing information in an effective way. Using C programming with the graphics.h library, basic graphical elements can be created easily. This experiment provides a clear understanding of how programming commands control graphical output and forms a foundation for advanced graphics applications.
